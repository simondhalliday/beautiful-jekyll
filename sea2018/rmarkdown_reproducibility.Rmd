## What will I talk about? 
.large[
- How we have used R Markdown in our undergraduate courses  

- Reproducibility with R Markdown

- And some things that we think are just cool in Rmd. 

- BIG Thank you to Project TIER and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation

- Currently R & R for J. Econ Ed... (fingers crossed)

## Lit & Gap

.huge[
Research about teaching empirics, data, basics of reproducibility

 - Capstone: McGoldrick (2008)
 - Reproducible Protocol: Ball & Madeiros (2012)
 - Data Literacy: Halliday (forthcoming)
 - Too advanced for UGs: Gentzkow & Shapiro (2014)
 - For professionals: Knittel and Metaxoglou (2018) 
 
Need one-stop-shop for *undergrads*.

## Benefits of R Markdown 
.large[- One-stop solution

- Work is *reproducible*

- Calibrated for collaboration

- Free (p = 0) 

- Broad & used in industry & research
]
---

# Costs and alternatives? 
.large[
Learning Curve for R and R Studio: 

- Packages facilitate learning: 

  - new packages: `tidyverse`, `mosaic`, `stargazer`
  
- error detection 
- autocomplete
- online educational courses
- plays well with Python (`reticulated Python`), SQL, JSON,
]

---

## Costs and alternatives? 
.large[
Stata and `dyndoc` (Stata 15)?

  - Too clunky (hard for students) 
  - different code for different formats (word, pdf, html)
  - doesn't produce output in the file (.do)
  - Conclusion: not a reasonable alternative
  - Not yet a "Stata Markdown"

Python and Jupyter Notebooks 

  - also free
  - not geared to statistical programming
  - no real educational server edition
]
---

## How we have used R Markdown
.large[
- Introductory econometrics
- Environmental Economics 
- Behavioral Economics
- Business analytics
- Seminars, theses and special studies


- Our Class sizes? 10-35 
    + Elsewhere: 80-120 (Duke, UCLA, Smith SDS/CS)

## R Markdown & Reproducibility 
.pull-left[
.large[
- What are traditional research reports? 
- Are they easily reproducible? 
- What gives us *soup to nuts* reproducibility? 
  - Easy Answer: R Markdown 
  - Hard answer: Scripted LaTeX + STATA
- Works with TIER Protocol

The Good 

- familiar format, e.g. Word 
- easy learning curve

The Bad

- tough for reproducibility
- difficult to update
- mistakes crop up
- teams can't collaborate easily

The Ugly? 

- Word/GDocs = Ugly?

<div class="col2"> 
```{r, out.width = "400px", fig.cap = "Courtesy of Bray, 2016"}
knitr::include_graphics("more/rmd_struct.png")
```


The good

- easy to reproduce
- easy to edit/update 
- easy to collaborate
- standardized & fast

The bad

- students must learn syntax
- error-free to compile

The ugly? 

- inequality in student backgrounds

# Raw Markdown

```{r, out.width = "800px", fig.cap = "Raw Markdown"}
knitr::include_graphics("more/raw_markdown.JPG")

# Knitted Markdown

# Text Formatting

    
    # Header 1

    ## Header 2

    ### Header 3

    This is normal sized text used in the body of our work. 

    For bullet points, we use dashes, e.g. 

    - Intro to RStudio
    - More content
      - a sub-point
    - Back to the original level
    
---

# Document Types

.large[
R Markdown can produce a variety of document types (other than the default `html` page):

- `pdf_document` makes a PDF with LaTeX (`.pdf`)
  
- `word_document` for Microsoft Word documents (`.docx`).
  
-`odt_document` for OpenDocument Text documents (`.odt`).
  
- `rtf_document` for Rich Text Format documents (`.rtf`) 
  
And others. 
]
---

# Presentation Types
.huge[
R Markdown can also produce a presentation (as with this presentation):

*   `io_slides` opens in your browser and interactive (`.html`)
  
*   `slidy` another browser based presentation format (`.html`)
  
*   `beamer` makes a PDF with LaTeX (`.pdf`)

# Data work
.huge[
Think about data analysis as falling into three loose categories: 

- management & wrangling
- visualization & summary statistics
- modeling & inference

All of this occurs in the code "chunk"
]
---


# Code Chunk: Example 

The option `echo = TRUE` means that the code gets included in the rendered html. 

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```


---

# Code chunks

.large[
- *Create a chunk*: Hit CMD + OPTION + I (MacOS) and CTL + ALT + I (Win)

- *Open a chunk*: Or type out three backticks ` folowed by {r} 

- *Close a chunk*: And then three more back ticks ` on another line. 

- *Options*: Within the {r} you can specify options, like {eval = FALSE} if you don't want it to evaluate the code

- *Labels*: Label the chunk, e.g. {r cars} labels the chunk "cars" in your ToC

# Math? 
.large[How about Bayes' Rule?]

$$Pr(\mbox{Outcome} | \mbox{signal}) = \frac{\theta p}{\theta p - (1 - \theta)(1 - p)}$$
.large[
R Markdown uses $\LaTeX$ for math and it immediately gets displayed in R Studio.  

- That is, $\LaTeX$ without the challenges of learning the packages, tables, etc that makes learning $\LaTeX$ so hard.
- In-line equations are bracketed by single dollar signs `$`. 
- Off-set equations are bracketed by double dollar signs `$$`. 
]
---
# What else? 
.large[
R Markdown and R Studio together:

- R Studio can show you the output of the commands *within* the R Markdown file ("lab notebook")
- R Studio has *error-detection* and *debugging* assistance for your code (unlike, e.g. STATA or aspects of Excel)
- Tab-completion of code!!!
- R Studio server hosted online and curate student experience
]

---

# Lessons from experience

.large[
- Students struggle with basic computing (working directory, file paths); but tab-completion helps

  -  drag-and-dropitis
  - inequality in baselines

- Students have to adjust to get Basics Right

  - Difference between a script (.R file - like a .do file) and a markdown document/notebook (.Rmd)
  - Difference between the .Rmd and the exported file: pdf, html, etc

- Students learn commands through graded assignments 
]


--- 


# Lessons from experience

- Students like (or are used to) WYSIWYG, which Rmd is not

 - Students are accustomed to MS Word & G docs which are WYSIWYG, but Rmd is not. 
- Installing packages

  - analogy: install apps (packages) to do different things on your phone (RStudio & R)
  - Chrome extensions

- Server = REALLY GREAT!


---


# Suggestions

.large[
- Use templates!
  - easy for students to "fill in blanks"
- Templates for projects & bibliography 
- Examples of math 
- Examples of tables 
- Use lab exercises liberally (please borrow ours!)
]

    - Reproduce in one (!) document
    - Professional appearance (with template)

Cost

* Somewhat higher startup cost in teaching R and R Studio

# How we have used R Markdown: Aaron

* Create slides in an Econometrics course
* Final project in senior research seminar 
* Create custom progress reports for students
* Interactive shiny apps for micro students

---

# How we have used R Markdown: Simon

* Behavioral Economics (upper-level; 20-35 students)
* Slides, notes and assignments & labs
* Students do a reproducible research project
* Reproduce the results of a published paper 
* Propose a new experimental design to test a new hypothesis
