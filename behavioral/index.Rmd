- What is *Economics* about? How does it inform policy?

- Behavioral Economics for Kids [here](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233702)
- Alm, James, 2017, "[Presidential Address: Is economics useful for public policy](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233701)", *Southern Economic Journal*, 83 (4), 835–854 (16 pages)
    - Why read this? I want to convince you, first, that economics itself is useful for informing policy decisions and, second, that behavioral economics is at least as useful too in informing policy-makers on how to construct policy too. But, we mustn't throw out the baby with the bathwater: "economics" and "behavioral economics" must be used appropriately. 

Recommended

- The Behavioral Economics Guide 2016, available [here](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233703). 
    - The BE Guide is useful for you to get a broad sense of what we do in Behavioral Economics and what kinds of ideas you might want to research in your team project.

-->

## Week 7: Learning & Information


### Tuesday 17 October


Reading
- Textbook & Lab

- Cartwright, Chapter 5 up to the end of Section 5.4 (feel free to exclude Section 5.3.4. if you're struggling to understand it as it may employ game theory you have not done)
- Also read section 6.4 from Chapter 6 (we are excluding the rest of Chapter 6)
- Gary Charness and Matthias Sutter, 2012, "[Groups make better self-interested decisions](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233863)," *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 26 (3): 157-176 (18 pages)

### Thursday 19 October

### ggplot Exercise
We are going to do an exercise where we use ggplot to try to reproduce at least one graphic from a published paper. The paper is: 

- Sutter, Matthias. 2009. "[Individual Behavior and Group Membership: Comment](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233834)" American Economic Review, 99(5): 2247-57.
- download the paper from Moodle here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46730](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46730)
- see the paper's page at the AER here: [https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.99.5.2247&fnd=s](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.99.5.2247&fnd=s)
- download the data on Moodle here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=46728](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=46728)
- see the online appendix for the paper here: [https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/feb2013/20101542_app.pdf](https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/feb2013/20101542_app.pdf)

Working with the data

- We will follow what to do at [Lab4](Lab4)
- You will notice that the data is *not* glyph-ready and it also isn't that *tidy*. 
- Ideally, we would work with the spreadsheet as is and import it into R. We're not going to do that, but will create different spreadsheets with different data and *then* import them into R. 
- Check out the TIER protocol for suggestions. 

Team Projects

- I want you to emphasize the following steps: 
    - making sure you have *data* to work with (to bring to later class sessions) 
    - deciding on the literature with which your project fits to produce a *literature review*
    - (later) thinking about the ways in which you can alter/improve on the existing experiments/surveys to improve our overall knowledge

## Week 8: Fairness and Social Preferences 
Do people only worry about their own consumption or their own money, or are they concerned (in prosocial or antisocial ways) about what others get? If they do care, what do their preferences look like? Are they altruistic? Are the reciprocal? What experiments do we use to check this and how can we understand the breadth of these preferences?

<!--
- Be sure to have gone through the ggplot exercise that we started on last week Thursday. 
- You can see my 'readme.txt' file here: [http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/readme.txt](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/readme.txt)
- You can see a step-by-step completion of the first part of the exercise in R here: [http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis)
- Once we've completed this exercise, I'll get started on Ch. 5 of Cartwright. 
- Then we'll spend a bit of time on group-work too.

`ggplot` exercise continued (depending on where we get to): 

- you're first going to need to make the data narrow using a key-value pair
- you'll then need to filter out data that you don't need for the first graph in the paper (i.e. you only want "teamtreat" and "individuals")
    - to do this, you'll need to use "logical operators". 
    - A logical operator is like an "and" sign "&"" or an "or" sign "|"
    - you'll need to use or "|" because you'll want to *keep* those observations in "teamtreat" or "individual"
- once you've filtered out the treatments you don't need, you can construct the ggplot code


### Tuesday 31 October 
See readings for Week 8. We focus on Kahneman et al and Cappelen et al today. 
We will also look at how to do citations in R Markdown at the [citations](citations) page.

And you can download the project template file [here](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=261455). You will need to download and use the `rticles()` package.
