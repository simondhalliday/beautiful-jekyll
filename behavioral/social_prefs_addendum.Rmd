## What constitutes a fair allocation? 

- Equality-efficiency tradeoffs => spectrum of views on fairness
- Ignore issues of:
    - entitlement 
    - desert
    - equity 
- Theories of reciprocity parameterize fairness/kindness in terms of a material payoff (in the feasible distribution; think DG/UG)

## Konow (JEL, 2003) (not online)

Survey evidence that people reject these simplistic ideals in favor of: 
 
 - equity 
 - attribution 
 - proportionality
 - desert 

## Konow continued

- People should *be* held accountable for their choices, effort 
- People should *not be* accountable for factors beyond their control
- Not clear exactly how *ability differences* fit in to prior theories of social preferences

## Cappelen et al (AER, 2007) 
People are heterogeneous in their ideas of fairness 

- Egalitarianism
- Libertarianism
- Intermediate ideals: 
    - equity theory, accountability principle, etc. 

## What’s fairness?
- "Fairness" means you are accountable for factors under your control 
- Differences in income stemming from (some subset of) 
    - effort, 
     - individual choices, 
     - innate ability, etc...
     - are "fair"
- But, inequality resulting from factors beyond agents’ control is not fair 
- So, what factors are beyond agents’ control?

## Cappelen (2007)
Modified dictator games preceded by team production phase

- Agent $i$ assigned return to investment, $a_i$
- Choose investment level, $q_i$
- Total income $X(a, q) = a_iq_i + a_jq_j$ is divided between $i$ and $j$
- Both $i$ and $j$ propose an allocation; one is chosen at random

## Why is this interesting? 

Implied fair allocation to other subject:

-  Egalitarianism $\Rightarrow m_i(a, q) = X(a, q)/2$
-  Libertarianism $\Rightarrow  m_i(a, q) = a_i q_i$
- "Liberal egalitarianism" $\Rightarrow m_i(a, q) = \frac{q_i}{q_i +q_j} \cdot X(a, q)$

## Details? 

- Each participant was randomly assigned a low or a high rate of return. 
    - Low $\Rightarrow 2x$ investment
    - High $\Rightarrow 4x$ investment
- Each participant got 300 NOK 
- Could invest 0, 100, 200 NOK in one of two choices

## Four outcomes 

1. both plays have same RoR & same investment
    - so fairness ideals then imply the same fair distribution (equal shares). 

2. same RoR but differed in their investment level
    - liberal egalitarian = libertarian fairness
    - strict egalitarianism would differ.
    
3. same Investment, but different RoR
    - Only libertarians considered an unequal distribution fair in this class of situations. 

4. different Investment & different RoR
    - if low RoR player invested more than high RoR, egalitarianism and libertarianism imply the same fair distribution.
    - Otherwise, the fairness ideals generally differ


## Summary Statistics 
```{r fig:sumstat, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:sumstat} Table 1. from Cappelen et al (2007: 223).", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
knitr::include_graphics("../more/captab1.png") 
```

## Model Estimates
```{r fig:estimates, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:estimates} Table 2. from Cappelen et al (2007: 223).", fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("../more/captab2.png") 
```

## Conclusions? 

- Really NB to think about heterogeneity 
- Pretty complicated methods to detect & isolate 
- Important policy implications (we get to later)
    - e.g. 1: crowding out
    - e.g. 2: assuming everyone self-interested?
