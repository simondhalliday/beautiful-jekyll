## Story so far? 

*How* a decision is presented affects people's actions 

- endowment effect
- status quo bias 
- WTP $\neq$ WTA
- loss aversion 

Lots of evidence from the laboratory, less from the "field".

Also, less evidence (though some) from "economically relevant" decisions. 

## What do haters say? 

These phenomena are explained by...

- bad experimental design 
- people who don't or haven't had time to learn

## Enter Hossain & List

- Data from a natural field experiment at Wanlida Group. 
- Wanlida $\Rightarrow$ top 100 electronics manufacturers

```

## Treatments

- "Reward/Gain": "positive frame" -- if the week's average per-hour production *reaches* a threshold, a *bonus* is paid at the end of the pay period. Weekly bonus = RMB 80.
- "Punishment/Loss": "negative frame" -- employees *provisionally given* the bonus *before* the week begins, if the week's average per-hour production *fails to reach* a threshold, the *bonus* is taken away at the end of the pay period. Weekly bonus = RMB 80.
- "Gift": just a control (also company wanted it): one-time four-week bonus of RMB 320

## Main Results 

1. Bonuses (of either type) increase productivity for groups and individuals. 
2. Punishment/Loss frame outperforms the gain frame for groups and individuals (less robust) $\Rightarrow$ an $\uparrow$ of 1% of production (this is economically significant) at low marginal cost
3. Effects are stronger for groups than individuals. 
4. Effects persist for whole period of study (long-term).

## Implications and Significance

1. Incentives are powerful & behavioral econ has a role in the workplace. 
2. Results complement industrial psch & expand toolset of practitioners. 
3. Social structure & institutions affect/constrain how people act in the workplace. 

## Institutional Detail 

- Teams of workers (14 people) engaged in relatively flexible production 
- Individual inspectors (of products) involved in incentive schemes too
- Can compare pre- and post-experiment: 
    - *productivity* in terms of output (DVD chips)
    - *quality* of productivity with error rate
- 4 weeks in a treatment; 1 week after a treatment ended


## Additional desing issues

- all payments made to all teams at the same time
    - improves credibility
    - limits time preference concerns
- compare *within* and *between* observations
    - same observation exposed to multiple treatments 
- workers didn't know about experiment
- management wanted targets achieved in 60-80% of cases (morale)
    - targets calibrated with pre-experiment data 
- minimized information transmission between groups

## Group effects over time

## Individual effect over time

```


## Discussion & Conclusion 

- Find strong treatment effects among teams of workers 
- Stronger effect for teams than individuals means how groups are formed is important: "collective esteem" in a group; "group polarization"; 
    - people are worried about letting team members down
    - workers in loss frame may be extra careful not to cost the team the bonus
    - large groups more likely to contain a very loss averse person
    
## Profitability

- Where incentives *profitable* for the firm? Yes!
    - Quality rate remained constant
    - Cost of incentives: RMB 64,960; 
    - To hire more workers for same output would have cost about RMB 69,900
- What about permanently adopting the bonuses/penalties? 
    - long-run effects of incentives 
    - no 'trend' in the effects; remain constant throughout study

Take home messsage: Behavioral econ can play a big role in improving productivity and profitability within firms.
