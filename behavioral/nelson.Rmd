## Published evidence on differences

- Croson & Gneezy (2009) argued for several differences in preferences across genders, but caveats: 
    - women were more variable than men and
    - women more responsive to cues/design than men
- Gneezy & List (2012) says there's even more evidence for gender differences in risk-taking 
- Nelson (2016) says these risk-taking differences are basically *negligible* and don't pay sufficient attention to *distribution*


## What does "difference" mean? 

    
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../more/xychromosome1.png")
```

    
## GDI: Individual
- GDI: Gender difference at the individual level
    - *categorical* difference between men & women
    - X/Y chromosomal differences by sex (biological difference)
    - what about social/cultural differences? hair length/clothing? 

## GDI: Individual?
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../more/lobotomy.jpg")
```

## GDA Aggregate?
- GDA: Gender difference at the aggregate level 
    - difference at aggregate, group, or distributional level, 
    - such as a difference between men’s and women’s average x values 
- Explanation?
    - smaller cross-group difference ($\bar{X_M} - \bar{X_F}$), 
    - the larger the variability or spread within each group $Var(M)$ and $Var(F)$
    - $\Rightarrow$ more overlap 
    - less the GDA $\rightarrow$ GDI
    
## GDA Aggregate?    
```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 4}
knitr::include_graphics("../more/nelsonfigure.png")
```    
    
## Ways to assess? Cohen's d: 

$$d = \frac{\bar{X_m} - \bar{X_f}}{\sigma_{pooled}} $$

- $\bar{X_m}$ Male average 
- $\bar{X_f}$ Female average 
- $\sigma_{pooled}$ pooled standard deviation (within-group variation)
- Also use "Common Language Effect Size (CLEF)": 
    - probability  a randomly chosen man would score higher than a randomly chosen woman

## Interpretation

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../more/nelsontable1.png")
```

## Results? 

Nelson looks at the original data in Gneezy & List (2012): 
 
- majority of differences found have confidence interval (CI) including $d = 0$
- few have CI including $d = 2$ 
- none have CI including $d = 3$
- take-home messages? 
    - be careful when talking about difference
    - present distribution figures
