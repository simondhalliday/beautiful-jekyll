My name is Simon D. Halliday. 

- I am an assistant professor of economics at Smith College, MA, USA. 
- I teach intermediate microeconomics, behavioral economics, development economics, the political economy of African development, introductory statistics and econometrics, and introductory microeconomics. 
- I do reseach in behavioral and experimental economics, with a focus on social preferences (reciprocity and social norms) and institutions (ratings, punishment, communication). 
- I also have a strong interest in research in economics education, particularly with respect to data literacy, data analysis, R and more. 
- I am the co-author (with Sam Bowles) of a forthcoming intermediate microeconomics textbook [*Microeconomics: Competition, Conflict and Coordination*](/microeconomics). 
- You can find a copy of my resume here.

## Naming?
I use my middle initial (that pesky 'D') because there's a former rugby player by the name of [Simon Halliday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Halliday) and you wouldn't want to confuse us.
