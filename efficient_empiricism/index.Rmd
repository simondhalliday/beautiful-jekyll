## D. Packages Recommended for Teaching R and R Markdown

- The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages written by developers affiliated with R Studio (Wickham 2017) that provides a variety of functions for data manipulation that are as easy, if not easier, to use than functions Stata-users typically use. Demonstrating the use of these functions to students, alongside the all-in-one visualization function , provides the basic infrastructure for teaching R in a way that does not require the steep learning curve that previously existed.

- `mosaic` is another useful package developed to teach statistics to undergraduates (Pruim, Kaplan, and Horton 2017). It provides a variety of functions that Stata-users would be accustomed to using, for example, tally is roughly equivalent to tab in Stata. It also incorporates some drop-down menu choices for creating graphics to teach the basics of plotting data and shows the commands that generate the graphical output. 

- `stargazer` is a package that helps to produce publication quality tables in R Markdown. It offers a friendly way to produce tables of summary statistics and regression results similar to Stata’s outreg, but with the added advantage that the integrated structure of Markdown inserts these tables directly into the text with no cutting or pasting necessary.
