## Introduction

In the context of my college’s closure for in-person classes, I’m
working on adapting my teaching to an online structure. A variety of
people have already linked to some great ideas online, such as [at
Stanford](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccsudB2vwZ_GJYoKlFzGbtnmftGcXwCIwxzf-jkkoCU/preview),
in the [Chronicle of Higher
Ed](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Going-Online-in-a-Hurry-What/248207?fbclid=IwAR1mi2nz38sjoG_Y7-be49a3p-CfZ5dV54qON8YP5irLIGXZ7nColWECwPI),
and [for K-12 teaching
online](https://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2020/02/29/the-best-advice-on-teaching-k-12-online-if-we-have-to-because-of-the-coronavirus-please-make-more-suggestions/).
What is my expertise with this stuff? Mostly, I’m a tech-engaged
faculty member and I’ve been elected to Smith’s Committee on Educational
Technology and I was appointed to the Ad Hoc Working Group on Learning
and Technology (which I’ve served on for three years). So what tools am
I using and what will my practices look like?

  - **[Zoom](https://zoom.us)**: Like almost everyone I’ll use Zoom to
    take my classes online synchronously. I will use it in combination
    with my iPad as a whiteboard and with PowerPoint slides for images
    and slide-based content. I will also use Zoom for break-out room
    discussions and for online office hours.

  - **Polling Software**: I will need to get instantaneous feedback
    about student understanding and either
    [PollEverywhere](https://polleverywhere.com) or
    [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com) can help me do this with students.

  - **[Slack](https://slack.com)**: I use Slack to communicate with my
    students already, but I’ll be using it even more intensely as our
    in-person classes shut down. I have the standard channels, plus
    channels for each team in my class (they have team projects) as well
    as for problem sets and the take-home midterm (which they will do
    after Spring Break, fingers crossed).

  - **Social annotation**: I will be using
    [perusall](https://perusall.com) and assigning students to groups to
    read and annotate different readings. I will recommend they upload
    their own team-specific readings and annotate them jointly too to
    make their team projects more feasible.

  - **Screencasts**: There are many, many ways to make screencasts these
    days, I recommend getting used to one of Panopto (syncs with Moodle)
    or QuickTime (created locally on a mac) or
    [ExplainEverything](https://explaineverything.com/) or
    [Educreations](https://www.educreations.com/) to create screencasts
    on an iPad/Tablet.

## Zooming into a Synchronous Classroom

What will I do with Zoom?

  - I will have my [AT2020 USB+
    Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-AT2020USB-Cardioid-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00B5ZX9FM)
    plugged in while I teach to improve sound quality. I like both this
    microphone and the [Jabra
    microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-PHS001U-Speakerphone-Retail-Packaging/dp/B007SHJIO2).
    I haven’t tested any USB-C microphones yet, but I would welcome
    recommendations.
  - I will have my iPad Pro plugged into my laptop via a
    [USB-C-Lightning
    Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MQGJ2AM-A-Lightning-USB-C/dp/B07CMN7DCX).
    Using [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) on my iPad, I can then
    treat my iPad like a white board using my Apple pencil and I can
    share it as a screen through Zoom. I can upload the notes as a pdf
    after class (I’ll likely do this weekly rather than after every
    class).
  - I will use screen sharing to share basic powerpoint slides.
  - I will record my classes locally with Zoom and upload them to my
    Moodle page (space permitting) and (more likely) to a private
    YouTube page.
  - Consider taking attendance using the ‘hand up’ feature on Zoom.
    Windows: Students can use the Alt+Y keyboard shortcut to raise or
    lower their hand. Mac: Students can use the Option+Y keyboard
    shortcut to raise or lower their hand.
  - Use the Chat in Zoom to allow students to ask questions (or Slack,
    which has emoji responses; I’ll likely use a combination).
  - I will teach my classes in their normally scheduled times and I will
    record them in case students who travel home (another time zone)
    can’t make the normally scheduled time.
  - I will force breaks in my classes; more than I usually would for a
    standard in-person class. I suspect I’ll have at least two
    five-minute breaks for each of my standard class times.
  - My students need to read papers for both of my classes and they need
    to work on their team projects. I will use Zoom’s “breakout rooms”
    feature to facilitate discussion of papers and I will assign
    students to breakout rooms for them to discuss their team projects
    as they need to. I also use [Marty Olney](https://eml.berkeley.edu//~olney/)’s “[reading
    guide](http://simondhalliday.com/more/reading-guide.doc)” as a way
    to facilitate discussing papers in these classes and students will
    share their guides with each other in Slack.

### Polling Software and Quizzes

  - I want to be able to see whether my students understand what we’re
    covering, so I shall use chatting & Slack (below) to answer
    questions, but I also want to see whether students grasp basic ideas
    we cover in class. An excellent way to do that is with in-class
    polling for MCQs, True/False questions, and more (also, the evidnece
    is on our side here, see [Brown, Roediger and McDaniel
    ( 2014)](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013),
    and [Lang
    (2016)](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Teaching-Everyday-Lessons-Learning/dp/1118944496);
    I’m also going to be taking a look at [Darby and Lang
    ( 2019)](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Teaching-Online-Applying-Learning-ebook/dp/B07SD7FJZ7)
    over spring break.)
  - [PollEverywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/) and
    [Kahoot](http://kahoot.com/) are two really easy to use tools for
    creating polls and facilitating interactivity for your class. I like
    PollEverywhere because my institution has an institutional log-in,
    but Kahoot is also great.
  - Here is a
    [presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mB0-RPzeB0guW6OTax_ac2_YIvLS0R7VL9hU2iwVn9Y)
    I gave on using PollEverywhere with some step-by-step examples at
    the end.
  - I like Polling for multiple choice question (MCQ) examples, for word
    clouds about ideas recalled from a previous class or sentiments
    about a current topic, and for annotating images (this requires
    using the browser/app version; especially useful if you ask an image
    about an economic graph).

## Communication: Slack, Piazza, or similar

  - I will use Slack heavily in my class. Why? It’s better than email
    because I can get one message and multiple people can respond
    (positive externalities people\!). Also, students feel less pressure
    with slack because they can be more informal than with email.
  - Take a look at [this
    presentation](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2019/onlineprogram/ViewPresentation.cfm?file=305068.pdf)
    by my superhero colleague [Albert
    Kim](https://rudeboybert.rbind.io/) in Stats & Data Science on using
    Slack in classes.
  - Students can respond to a message with an emoji (really helpful to
    identify whether they’ve seen something or understand something).
  - Students can start threads in channels that are specific to, say, a
    problem set, reading, or midterm.
  - I have assigned students to Slack channels specific to their teams
    for particular team projects. They will chat in each of these
    channels and I will see Google docs that they link to, articles they
    share with each other, and similar.
  - Do encourage your students to download the Slack app to their
    laptops and their phones given how important communication will be
    when classes go online.

### Social Annotation

  - For my upper-level class, I will use
    [Perusall](https://persuall.com) for papers for the rest of the
    semester.
  - I will upload PDFs of the papers to Perusall.
  - My students can log in with their Smith College accounts and access
    their readings in a way that is consistent with copyright policy
    (praise be).
  - They can then annotate and comment on the papers in a way that
    allows them to respond to their fellow students (and in my tweaking
    of grades this semester, I suspect) get participation points for
    doing so\! Yay\!
  - It will also indicate to me the hotspots for their understanding and
    I’ll be able to ensure that I can go to the readings to make sure
    that the’ve grasped the main ideas or identify what they’ve
    struggled with.
  - Alternatives to Perusall include
    [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) and
    [nb](https://nb.mit.edu/welcome), among others, I’m sure.

### Creating Screencasts

  - I have mostly used
    [ExplainEverything](https://explaineverything.com/) to create
    screencasts using my iPad.
  - To do this, I upload a set of presentation slides in powerpoint and
    combine these with using EE as a whiteboard (again using my Apple
    pencil).
  - Because a good microphone helps, I also plug my microphone into my
    iPad using a [USB-Lightning
    adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W2AM/A/lightning-to-usb-3-camera-adapter).
  - I create screencasts and upload them to a private YouTube channel
    for my students.
  - If I am only going to voice over ppt slides, then I tend to use my
    laptop with [QuickTime
    Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime). Very easy,
    just click on File -\> New Screen Recording and go for it\! I upload
    the file it creates to YouTube.
  - You can also just record with Zoom and upload that, or, if you have
    access to [Panopto](panopto.com) (as we do at Smith), then it’s easy
    to create a screen recording with Panopto that automatically
    synchronizes with Moodle (add the Panopto “block” to your moodle
    page, download the app, click on “Create New Recording”; see
    [here](https://support.panopto.com/s/article/add-panopto-block-moodle-course-2)).

### Broad ideas

  - For some suggestions about a variety of tools see a
    [presentation](http://simondhalliday.com/laptoptime/) I gave with
    [Randi Garcia](https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/randi-garcia)
    on technological tools we use in our classrooms. Randi is also a
    tech in the classroom champ\!
  - I’ll also be using github, [trello](https://trello.com/), Google
    drive, and Moodle, but I’m not going into those here.

### How many tools?

I’m going to be using a bunch of different tools to improve my students’
online learning experience. Students will adapt. They want to learn. It
will take us all some time to adapt, but because they are motivated and
I am motivated, we’ll all learn and I’ll know better what to do next
time I have to teach online. All of which said, I plan to cut down my
overall coverage of topics. I don’t believe I’ll be able to cover as
much as I’d originally hoped to cover. And that’s OK. If the worst thing
that happens to my students because of COVID-19 is that they take some
classes online and miss an extra chapter or two in a class, that’s fine.
They will also have learned some new skills. They’ll have learned to
improve their ability to collaborate and articulate questions and
concerns in Slack. They’ll have learned how to use video conferencing
software (and, importantly, to mute themselves\!). They’ll have learned
how useful collaborative software of various types can be and how they
can become more productive as free-lancers or people who have to work
remotely in the future.


### My class context? 

My classes this semester are relatively small. Behavioral Economics is an upper-level elective that involves a lot of reading and programming work in R \(n = 16\). Development economics is a lower-level elective with a textbook, readings, and a team project \(n = 20\). All of which said, I've used some of the techniques outlined above for classes of \>50 at Smith College and for classes of a few hundred at institutions I taught at before Smith College. 

I'm fortunate because I do not have in-class exams for my classes this semester and I would recommend that folks try to think through a class without exams. What are alternative assessment methods that might work? I don't mean "work the best ever", I mean "work well enough." Think *very* short writing assignments. Think about asking your students to create MCQs that you can ask the rest of the class with extra credit given to the "best" MCQ. Err on the side of generosity rather than worrying about cheating. Will cheating happen? Almost certainly? But, if you want to base your policy on an expectation that all students are knaves \(thanks Hume; thanks Machiavelli\), you're going to have an awful rest of your semester. Rather, plan for your students to be pro-social and intrinsically motivated and you might just [nudge them to be more so](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EUYN5GM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).
