## Excel Real-World Data Exercise Sample Documents

- Note: I cannot provide the data on a public site, a potential user can request the NIDS and upon that request I can share data and/or do files. The data are publicly available, but the user should preferably access the data herself at the DataFirst Research Unit.

## R Code for figures in the paper 
I coded all of the figures in the paper in R. I provide links to the R code for the figures. This is intended for instructors or interested advanced students and should not be viewed as part of the exercise itself. 

- Figure 1: "The Lorenz Curve for Economy J is shown by the solid black line. The line of perfect equality is shown by the dashed line." [Code](https://github.com/simondhalliday/simondhalliday.github.io/blob/master/data_literacy_for_development/lorenz_employment_numeric.R) 
- Figure 2: "Bar chart to calculate Gini for Economy D. Data are from Table 3" [Code](https://github.com/simondhalliday/simondhalliday.github.io/blob/master/data_literacy_for_development/lorenz_barchart_economyD.R)
- Figure 3: "Lorenz curves for artificial countries. Data are from Table 3." [Code](https://github.com/simondhalliday/simondhalliday.github.io/blob/master/data_literacy_for_development/halliday_inequality_lorenz_set.R)
