- "Third-Party vs. Second-Party Control: Disentangling the Role of Autonomy and Reciprocity:" with Gabriel Burdin (Leeds University and IZA) and Fabio Landini (LUISS). We propose an extension of Falk and Kosfeld's (AER, 2006) experimental design to illuminate the role of autonomy in explaining how individuals react to control in a principal-agent relationship. We add a third party who exerts control over the agent and find that control-aversion ceases to exist. A draft of the paper is available as [IZA discussion paper 9251](http://ftp.iza.org/dp9251.pdf). *Revisions requested and re-submitted*. 
- "Risk-Taking in the Classroom:" Co-authored with Justine Burns and Malcolm Keswell ( University of Cape Town), this paper is based on an experiment with intermediate microeconomics students at the University of Cape Town where we varied the number of negative points a student could receive for an incorrect answer to assess attitudes to risk. Available as SALDRU [Working Paper 87](http://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/home/index.php?/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,32/gid,437/task,doc_download/). *\textit{*Under submission*. 
- "The Effects of Major-Job Mismatch on Early Career Earnings and Job Satisfaction," with Roger Kaufman and Louise Yu. We use the U.S. Department of Education's Baccalaureate and Beyond restricted survey data to estimate the determinants of major-job mismatch and its effects on post-graduate earnings and job satisfaction. After controlling for ability, we find that graduates who chose undergraduate majors that provided substantial occupational and job-specific training are more likely to work in jobs that are closely related to their majors one and four years after graduation and have higher earnings and greater job satisfaction. *Under submission*. 
- "Data Literacy in Economic Development", Based on teaching Economic Development (ECO211) at Smith College, I have developed a series of exercises to model the data analysis that a student would use in analyzing a household survey (the South African National Income Dynamics Study) with either MS Excel or Google Spreadsheets. I report on these in the paper and presented the draft at the CTREE 2016 and LAC-DEV 2016 conferences. *Under submission*.
